# Resc4You-FrontEnd
The project has 3 users: citizens, volunteers, and administrators.
 Citizens submit help requests via POST, and a smart algorithm matches them with available volunteers based on specialization and location.
 Real-time communication and push notifications are used to update status and alert volunteers of new requests.
 A challenging project with the use of many technologies and libraries
